* Tasklist
- [ ] Replace Kerbal Jets with Time delaying mechanic
- [ ] BUG: Adding multiple enemies at once via EventFactory creates super fast enemies
- [ ] STRUCTURE: Add "AI PATH" hook to Enemy AI, so that we can, for example,
  create an alien that follows a sinoidal or linear, fixed path
- [ ] STRUCTURE: Break difficulty into "Wave" and
  "Difficulty". Difficulty is selected by the player, and only affects
  enemy health.
- [ ] STRUCTURE: GameScene can report on the number of enemies, and the number of enemies by class
- [ ] STRUCTURE: enemies can test their hitbox against the game hitbox to test if they are "on screen"

- [ ] BALANCE: Random Generation of enemies: Each enemy type has a generation probability, cooldown, 
      and "MAX ON SCREEN" - Wave/Difficulty affects these values

- [ ] UI: Transition between screens - add input ignoring during transitions
- [ ] UI: Enemies "doRoar" rarely

* "Screen Shaking"
- [ ] ENEMIES with low HP
- [ ] ENEMIES are pushed back with shots
- [ ] FASTER Bullets
- [ ] BIGGER explosions of enemies
- [ ] MORE weak enemies
- [ ] MUZZLE animation
- [ ] SCREEN shaking
