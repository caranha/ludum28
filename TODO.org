- [X] Mouse Controls Suggested by Scott
- [ ] Balance Scott's Control Sugestion
  - Implemented Scott's controls - It is still kinda hard to control
    with the mouse.
  - Maybe I need to modify the dino's speed?
  - Or maybe I need to track mouse movement and repeat it, instead of
    using drag to determine direction?

- [X] Made Bullets easier to see

- [ ] BUG: Adding multiple enemies at once via EventFactory creates super fast enemies
- [ ] STRUCTURE: Add "AI PATH" hook to Enemy AI, so that we can, for example,
  create an alien that follows a sinoidal or linear, fixed path
- [ ] STRUCTURE: Break difficulty into "Wave" and
  "Difficulty". Difficulty is selected by the player, and only affects
  enemy health.
- [ ] STRUCTURE: GameScene can report on the number of enemies, and the number of enemies by class
- [ ] STRUCTURE: enemies can test their hitbox against the game hitbox to test if they are "on screen"

- [ ] BALANCE: Random Generation of enemies: Each enemy type has a generation probability, cooldown, 
      and "MAX ON SCREEN" - Wave/Difficulty affects these values

- [ ] UI: Transition between screens - add input ignoring during transitions
- [ ] UI: Enemies "doRoar" rarely
